## Converting the Pokemon FSM to a regex

So we have a simple Pokemon FSM, like this one:

From here, the question is, how do we turn this FSM into a regular expression?

One method is the [state-removal method](http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2016/how-to-convert-finite-automata-to-regular-expressions), which involves continually removing states from the FSM, and updating the edges accordingly.

If you're interested in the specifics of the algorithm, I recommend looking over that link.

But, as an example, let's remove upper-right state of the following FSM as see an example.

<center><img src="images/pkmn/state-removal-1.png" height="300"></center>

Consider the leftmost node. It is possible to transition to the upper right node and then back to the leftmost node again by moving `R->[RUN]*->L`.

If we remove the upper-right node, though, this transition will be lost. So, the first step to take is to **combine this transition into a single edge**. In this figure we do the same for the bottommost node as well.

Both the leftmost node and the bottommost node already have self-looping transitions, though. So, we combine this new self-loop with that self-loop. **This constitutes updating the regex on each of the self-loop edges.** We're not done yet, but the updated FSM looks like this:

Finally, we notice that for the leftmost node to transition to the bottommost node, we need only transition `R->[RUN]*->D`.

Again, though, if we were to remove the rightmost node, this transition would be lost. So, **we must draw a new edge with this label between the leftmost node and the bottommost node.** If we do this in the reverse, too, so that the bottommost node is connected with the leftmost node, we can fully remove the top-right node.

And that is the state removal strategy.

And if we apply that exact strategy to the FSM for the maze we had previously we get something that looks very similar:

If we continue with this strategy, and delete a few more states, **our FSM will eventually look like this:**

<center><img src="images/pkmn/simple-reduced-2.png" height="300"></center>

And by concatenating regexes on these edges, **we finally obtain the regex that accepts any moveset that completes the maze:**

`([LUN]|R[RUN]*L|D[LDN]*U|(R[RUN]*D|D[LDN]*R)([DN]|U[RUN]*D|L[LDN]*R)*(U[RUN]*L|L[LDN]*U))*(R[RUN]*D|D[LDN]*R)([DN]|U[RUN]*D|L[LDN]*R)*R[RLDUN]*`

**All that for a dinky 5-space maze?!?!?!?** You can begin to see how quickly this gets out of control.
