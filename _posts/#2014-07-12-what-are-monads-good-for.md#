You're a programmer.

You Google something innocuous, like [what is a monad good for](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what%20are%20monads%20good%20for)
([or](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+are+monads+used+for)

[the](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=monads+in+real+life)
[question](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=what+is+the+point+of+monads)).

**Q:** Do you get something sensible?

**A:** No. You get page after page of nonsense trying to tell you what
  a monad *is*.

And so you think, **What? What is this? Why will no one *just say what
they're good for?* What are you hiding from me? Is this some kind of
weird cult?**

Here are some things monads are good for.

leads to
