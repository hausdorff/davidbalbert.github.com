So I need a project. I mean, I really don't need a project. I have a lot on my plate including a [mobile phone virtualization][1] project on top of [Android][2] which I'm quite a bit behind on (more on that at a later date), but I still feel like I need a project. I want to learn board layout, which is something that isn't really taught in school. It's a shame that it isn't because the more and more I think about it, I realize I didn't become a Computer Engineer to learn how to design components, but to learn how to use them.

## The Plan

What I'd really like to do is design an arm board and get Linux running on it. Unfortunately, I think if I tried this now, I would never get it done. I don't even think I'd know where to start. What I need to do is start smaller. I've always wanted one of those lcd dot matrix scrolls that are used to advertise the lotto jackpot, but even that might be a bit too much for the first project. What I'd like to do is start with only one of the display segments - the kind that can fit one letter - and work my way up from there. Here are my requirements:

 * avr based

 * Persistent storage

 * Programmable over serial

 * Can do multi-frame animation

 * Looks totally cool

That's really about it. If I can get one segment up and running, it shouldn't be too hard to get a bunch running in tandem, and from there, its off to the races. I'm going to try to get a bill of materials up by next week, but these things have a habit of falling behind, especially when I'm not getting a grade.

## The Questions

I really don't know what to expect, so if you've had any experience with anything like this, drop me a line and tell me all the things that I'm going to screw up before I actually do it. Also, this project needs a kick ass name. Give me your suggestions.
