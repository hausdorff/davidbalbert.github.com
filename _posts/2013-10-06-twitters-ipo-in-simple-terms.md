The short answer is that this is looking good for Twitter, but the particulars of why the timing here is so excellent are actually really interesting.

## Next year would be a comparatively bad time to file.
Right now, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) act allows "emerging" companies like Twitter to file confidentially. This allows them to (1) avoid a lot of the hype problems Facebook had to deal with, and (2) allows them to address finance questions from the SEC in private, which allows them to largely avoid the problems Groupon ran into.

More importantly, they're on track to make $1 billion in the fiscal year, which is the cutoff for eligibility for filing as an emerging company under the JOBS act. This means that this is probably their last chance to file confidentially.

## The climate for a Twitter IPO is quite good right now.
Stocks of similar Internet companies are doing quite well, so investors are likely to look favorably on a Twitter IPO. A very good sign is that Facebook is up to ~$50/share, which is well above their listing price of $38. Other recent-ish IPOs, like LinkedIn are also doing well, but the recovery of Facebook (and, to a lesser extent, Groupon) is what investors will be thinking of, due comparatively painful experience.

The only real problem I see with IPO'ing at right now is the government shutdown -- historically investors are very sensitive to market context at offerings like this. Still, it's hard to predict how this will affect Twitter, and management is still holding enough enough cards (and holding them closely enough) that they will probably pull out of this ahead.

## Twitter needs the IPO.
Because the filling was private, the valuation comes from an internal audit -- they value themselves at $20.62/share for a total implied valuation of $9.7 billion.

Based on this valuation, Twitter looks to be raising $1 billion.

They need these funds primarily for growth, and especially for flexibility in competing with companies like Facebook. But if Twitter plans to grow, it's prudent to ask where they are now.

Their revenue is closing in quickly on nine digits, and growing precipitously. Monthly actives were 218 million in June 2013, up from 151 million in June 2012, and 169 million of whom were outside the US. Twitter is a product that is inherently mobile, and their mobile metrics look good in ways that Facebook's don't, which could be a serious advantage down the road.

Depending on where you stand on these metrics, you will either agree or disagree that a capital injection will give Twitter the leverage they need to pursue the high-impact growth opportunities. In particular, it's worth noting that:

* Twitter is not a profitable company, -- they lost $69 million in the first 6 months of 2013. An injection of capital is going to need to produce a sharp upward inflection in revenue, eventually. (Their $315 acquisition of MoPub, an advertising firm, is a step in the right direction -- but it's worth wondering what their plan overall is.)
* In America, they make $2 per 1000 views. But outside America, they make just $0.30 per 1000 views. In their own documents they admit that capitalizing on foreign markets could require very serious consumption of resources. This is worrying in the long term because 300 million people live in the US, while 6 billion people live elsewhere.
* They are better suited to mobile than Facebook -- and mobile is the place where Facebook is decidedly not dominant. How, if at all do they plan to exploit this? Especially abroad.

There are more issues like these, of course -- you could go on for hours talking about them.

But the point is not that these issues can't be defeated, but that it would be harder to do so without the capital Twitter is asking for. So the question for Twitter is, can they afford to ask for the money now? Personally, it's hard for me to see how they can *not* afford to ask now.


## Conclusions
Overall I'd say that things are looking good for Twitter. There is the usual air of uncertainty that comes with social media, a notoriously fickle and tempestuous niche in tech.

But, it's hard to imagine Twitter could have expected a more fortuitous time to file.
