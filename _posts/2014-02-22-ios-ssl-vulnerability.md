title: Typo in Apple's SSL implementation causes uniform failure to validate key exchanges

**UPDATE:** I guess Apple has released a [statement](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT6147) explaining that they're not going to explain this issue, including how big of a deal it is. Ok, then I will.

**UPDATE 2:** Well, looks like Chad beat me to [posting the file to Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7281378). Heh.


Tonight my friend Chad Brubaker[1] pointed me at an interesting problem.

Apple has been rolling out an iOS update to fix a critical flaw in their SSL implementation. His challenge to me: figure out the problem with the SSL stack. (I think he'd already figured it out but he went to bed before I could ask him.)

Unfortunately, people have been really tight-lipped about it. One researcher [remarked](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/22/apple-flaw-idUSL2N0LR07920140222) that "It's as bad as you could imagine, that's all I can say." So far no one has stepped forward to explain.

Well, after some snooping, it turns out to be a typo in the function `SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange` in [sslKeyExchange.c](http://opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-55471/libsecurity_ssl/lib/sslKeyExchange.c?txt). Specifically, near the bottom of the function we see the following code:

```c
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &serverRandom)) != 0)
    goto fail;
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0)
    goto fail;
    goto fail;
if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.final(&hashCtx, &hashOut)) != 0)
    goto fail;

err = sslRawVerify(ctx,
                   ctx->peerPubKey,
                   dataToSign,				/* plaintext */
                   dataToSignLen,			/* plaintext length */
                   signature,
                   signatureLen);
```

Notice anything weird? That second `if` has two `goto fail` statements underneath it. So:

* The function `SSLVerifySignedServerKeyExchange` is supposed to verify the key exchange.
* But, the second `goto fail` causes us to *always* jump to the `fail` label, no matter what. Even if the SHA1 update worked.
* In particular, this means that we *always* bypass the call to `sslRawVerify`, which would normally occur just beneath the `if` statements.
* And therefore, the error code `err` doesn't get set in the event that the verification fails.
* As you can imagine, this is a pretty bad flaw. This makes it very easy to execute man-in-the-middle attacks on iOS users.

This has got to be the bug of the year. Needless to say, **I recommend you upgrade your Apple products quickly.**
